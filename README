This git repository includes two python packages, sblj and gen,
for working with the LabJacks in the
Starburst system at Owens Valley Radio Observatory.  sblj is a
python wrapper for the Starburst LabJacks, working with each LabJack
as an object with properties specific to its role in the system
(LO/Noise Module or downconverter module).  gen is a module for
collecting and formatting the monitor data from the LabJacks to
provide to the ACC (the OVSA's Array Control Computer) in xml format.
